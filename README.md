## Our process

Firstly, we created our fundametal part with HTML. After, created CSS for HTML file. It is our design. Also, we used JavaScript for buttons which change our photo and information (switching the information).

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript

### What We learned

We learned Switching the pages using JavaScript. 


### Continued development

We are just started to learn JavaScript language. We think that to the end of our course we will know more than now. In future, we believe that our knowledge will be enough to create modern sites with challenging algorhitms.


### Useful resources
